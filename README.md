# Audiobook Player

This project is a proof of concept for handling the [Audiobook Manifest](https://github.com/HadrienGardeur/audiobook-manifest) in a Web App.

The player is a simple Web App that does the following things:

- play the different tracks using an `<audio>` element
- show the audiobook cover
- cache the different tracks to listen to your audiobook offline
- skip between tracks
- save your current position in the audiobook between sessions

##Live Demo

A live demo of the player is available at: https://hadriengardeur.github.io/audiobook-manifest/player/
